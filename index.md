### [Wolfenstein 3D-style Raycaster](https://cljord.github.io/raycaster/) <br>
A simple [Raycaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) in the style of [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), written in pure JavaScript and using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for line drawing and keyboard input. No other libraries used. Move around with the arrow keys.

# Education

- M.Sc. Computer Science at University of Bonn, 2021 - December 2023. The title of my thesis was **"Utilising fractional values in primal heuristics to solve MaxCut with Branch-and-Bound"** and was concerned with: parallelising the execution of heuristics during the main branch-and-bound search - modifying and implementing MaxCut-specific heuristics to (hopefully) speed up the computation process - using improvement heuristics - running a large-scale experimental comparison. This resulted in considerable speed-ups and increases in the efficiency of the solver when solving the MaxCut problem.

- B.Sc. Informatik (Computer Science) at University of Bonn, 2018-2021. The title of my thesis was **"Klassifikation temporaler Graphen mit Graphkernen" ("Classifying temporal graphs with graph kernels")**. I modified an [algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3018661.3018731) for counting occurences of structures in temporal graphs so it could be used with node-labeled date. This allowed the adaptation of a [static graphlet kernel](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/shervashidze09a.html) to work with labeled, temporal graphs and subsequent classification of these graphs with a [Support Vector Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine). In practice, this would allow e.g. modeling the spread of diseases in a network. The results achieved here were quite strong and we ended up publishing a paper on the basis of my work, see below.

# Publication

- I have exactly one paper to my name: [A Temporal Graphlet Kernel For Classifying Dissemination in Evolving Networks. L Oettershagen, NM Kriege, C Jordan, P Mutzel](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611977653.ch3). It is based on the results of my Bachelor's thesis, but with improvements. It received the **Best Paper Award** at the [18th International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs](http://www.mlgworkshop.org/2023/).
